DeviceNanny is a device lab checkout system. It was designed with one goal in mind: be as reliable as possible. In fact, it's so reliable that you can't not use it. Devices are connected to the system via USB, and USB actions trigger the check-in, checkout, or device addition processes. Say hello to a fully charged device lab with an accurate inventory of available devices.

Features:
- Super simple checkout and check-in process triggered by USB connections/disconnections
- Every device is fully charged and ready
- Renew your expired checkouts through your browser
- Slackbot notifications when you check out/in a device
- Slackbot reminders to check in a device
- Monitor available devices, reliably, through your browser
- Channel alerts when a device is taken without being checked out
- Monitor device checkout activity in a Slack channel
- Easily add devices to the database by plugging them in
- RFID for devices not plugged in via USB
- Smart script to fix situations where devices could be taken/returned without being checked in/out


Hardware Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi (version 3 recommended)
- Raspberry Pi power supply
- Cool Raspberry Pi case
- USB hubs for power and data (must be able to power all connected devices)
- USB cords for all devices
- RFID reader (optional for devices that won't connect via USB)
- RFID tags (optional for devices that won't connect via USB)

Required packages if not using Debian Jessie:
- lightdm as default display manager
- zenity
